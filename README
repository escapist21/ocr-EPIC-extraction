Since mid-2018 all new electoral rolls published in the pdf format by the Election Commission of India (ECI) has been mandated 
to be changed to scanned copies of the original files.

With this change, extraction programmes like Tabula no longer works with such files.

The alternative is to somehow extract the EPIC nos from the pdf files using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technologies
like Tesseract and then using it to view/download data related to the EPIC no. 

This is most helpful for pdfs that are in native/state languages with only the EPIC no in English

The two files in this repository helps to achieve this function

The file named 'ocr_eroll_extraction.py' uses the tesserocr library with english as the language to extract all data from the 
pdfs. Though most of it is garbage, the EPIC no which is in English is mostly preserved. All the eroll pdfs in a folder can be 
held in memory using the glob module and after running ocr written to a txt file using the 'with open' command in python.

The second file named 'regex_epics_extraction.py' can then be run on the extracted txt file to create a list of all EPIC nos. 
The python regular expression module has been used to achieve this. 
There are two different patterns in which EPIC nos are mostly found.
The most common pattern is made of 10 characters in the sequence 'ABC1234567' and the second pattern is made of 15 characters 
in the sequence 'AB/01/23/456789'
